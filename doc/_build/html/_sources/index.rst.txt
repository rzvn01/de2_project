Weather Station Documentation
=============================

Welcome to the documentation for the Weather Station project. This project utilizes ESP32 microcontrollers, various sensors, and MicroPython to create a weather station. The station collects real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and light level, and displays this information on a screen. Additionally, the station can log and export sensor data and integrates a weather forecasting feature.

**You can find the Git repository for the project** `here. <https://github.com/rzvn01/de2_project/>`_
