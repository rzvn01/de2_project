## Theoretical Description and Explanation

Our project focuses on implementing a versatile system that combines various sensors, such as Light Dependent
Resistors (LDRs), water sensors, and a BME280 sensor, with displays. The goal is to create a portable device that
can monitor environmental conditions, providing real-time data on light levels, water presence, temperature, humidity,
and pressure. The system utilizes MicroPython, making it easy to deploy and program.

## Hardware Description of Demo Application

Our hardware setup includes:

- Microcontroller (ESP32): Serves as the brain of the system, running MicroPython.
- OLED & LCD Displays (e.g., SH1106, 1602A): Displays information collected from sensors.
- Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs): Measure ambient light levels.
- Water Sensors: Detect the presence of water.
- BME280 Sensor: Measures temperature, humidity, and pressure.

## Software Description

The software consists of several components:

1. **LDR Class:**
    - Represents the Light Dependent Resistor sensor, allowing reading of light levels.
    - Source File: [ldr.py](https://github.com/rzvn01/de2_project/blob/main/utilities/ldr.py)
    - Usage: `ldr = LDR(pin)`

2. **WaterSensor Class:**
    - Represents the water sensor, capable of detecting water presence.
    - Source File: [water_sensor.py](https://github.com/rzvn01/de2_project/blob/main/utilities/water_sensor.py)
    - Usage: `water_sensor = WaterSensor(pin)`

3. **BME280 Class:**
    - Represents the BME280 sensor, providing methods for reading temperature, humidity, and pressure.
    - Source File: [bme280.py](https://github.com/rzvn01/de2_project/blob/main/utilities/bme280.py)
    - Usage: `bme = BME280()`

4. **WiFiManager Class:**
    - Manages Wi-Fi connectivity for the device.
    - Source File: [wifi_manager.py](https://github.com/rzvn01/de2_project/blob/main/utilities/wifi_manager.py)
    - Usage: `wifi_manager = WiFiManager(ssid, password)`

5. **DisplayManager Class:**
    - Manages the displays.
    - Source File: [display_manager.py](https://github.com/rzvn01/de2_project/blob/main/utilities/display_manager.py)
    - Usage: `displayManager = DisplayManager()`

## Setting Up the Hardware

1. Connect LDRs, water sensors, the BME280 sensor, and the displays to the microcontroller according to the provided
   schematic.
2. Power up the microcontroller.

## Flashing MicroPython

To use MicroPython with a real ESP32 board, you will need to follow these steps:

* Download MicroPython firmware
* Flash the firmware
* Connect to the Board's Serial REPL and interact with MicroPython
* Transfer files to the ESP32 board

There are several very good tutorials how to install and use MicroPython on an ESP microcontroller, such
as [this one](https://pythonforundergradengineers.com/how-to-install-micropython-on-an-esp32.html) for Windows. The
following text was tested under Linux-based operating system.

> **NOTE:** The MicroPython firmware can also be flashed by Thonny IDE.

1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Open terminal (typically `Ctrl+Alt+T`) and install `esptool`:

    ```shell
    pip install esptool
    ```

   Connect your ESP board and test
   the [`esptool`](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esptool/en/latest/esp32/esptool/basic-commands.html#):

    ```shell
    # Get the version
    esptool.py version

    # Read chip info, serial port, MAC address, and others
    # Note: Use `dmesg` command to find your USB port
    esptool.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 flash_id

    # Read all eFuses from the chip
    espefuse.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 summary
    ```

**For ESP32 chips:**

3. [Download](http://micropython.org/download/) the latest firmware for your target device, such
   as `esp32-20230426-v1.20.0.bin` for Espressif ESP32.

4. Erase the Flash of target device (use your port name):

    ```shell
    esptool.py --chip esp32 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 erase_flash
    ```

5. Deploy the new firmware:

    ```shell
    esptool.py --chip esp32 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 write_flash -z 0x1000 esp32-20230426-v1.20.0.bin
    ```


## Generate SPHINX Documentation

To generate the documentation using Sphinx, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the source directory:**

    ```bash
    cd \doc
    ```

2. **Build the HTML documentation using Sphinx:**

    ```bash
    sphinx-build -b html . _build\html
    ```

   This command generates HTML documentation from the source files (current directory `.`) and places the output in the `_build\html` directory.

3. **Change to the HTML output directory:**

    ```bash
    cd _build\html\
    ```

4. **Open the `index.html` file in a web browser:**

    ```bash
    start index.html
    ```

## Viewing Documentation

You can view the generated HTML documentation by opening the [index.html](https://github.com/rzvn01/de2_project/blob/main/doc/_build/html/index.html) file in a web browser.

> **NOTE:** Ensure that you have Sphinx installed before following these steps (`pip install sphinx`).*


## Running the Application

1. Power on the device.
2. Make sure all files are saved into microcontroller's memory.
3. The displays should show real-time data from the sensors, including light levels, water presence, temperature,
   humidity, and pressure.

> **NOTE:** The wrapper for functionality must be saved as `main.py` in order to get the desired behaviour
> for  `deepsleep()` function.

## Troubleshooting

- If the device fails to connect to Wi-Fi, check your credentials and network availability.
- Ensure the sensors are correctly wired.
- Make sure all packages are up-to-date and not deprecated.
